# Resources for Measure Theory and Integration

The two resources I used all the time were:
- [Introduction to Real Analysis by Christopher
  Heil](https://heil.math.gatech.edu/real/) = love this book so much. The
  author explains everything clearly, guides through the big picture, provides
  enough intuition and still manage to provide rigorous math.
- [Video Lectures by Marcus
  Carlssons](https://www.youtube.com/@marcuscarlssonsmathematics2527/videos) =
  the best lectures you can find on measure theory. The best explanations I
  could ever find, intuition. His lectures are fun to watch.


## Some resources that might be useful
- [Notes on Measure Theory by William Chen](https://williamchen-mathematics.info/lnilifolder/lnili.html)
- [Measure Theory by François de
  Marçay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~joel.merker/Enseignement/Integration/theorie-de-la-mesure.pdf)
  = very rigorous with many visual explanations notes on measure theory.
- [just some video lectures on measure theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ad9V8gvyBQ) = I didn't watch it but someone might find that useful.

## Introductory level resources
