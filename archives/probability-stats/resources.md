  The professor Joseph Blitzstein explains clearly and actually he's my
  favourite probas professor.


  Actually, I recommend to read his book `Introduction to Probability` by
  Joseph Blitzstein. Not only does he provide definitions and theorems but also
  he provides lots of intuition, explanations and examples.
