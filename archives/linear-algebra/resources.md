## General

  if you don't watch this playlist - never do linear algebra. Everyone must
  watch, it is the bible of linear algebra. You can't find better resource to
  acquire intuition for linear algebra.
- [Wrath of
  Math](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLztBpqftvzxWT5z53AxSqkSaWDhAeToDG)
  - nice explanations for all the topics.
- [MIT course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgbWWjsq1DFNRwkA9EgWqOZgSM96zT_1k)

You should combine all the three above.

Worth mentioning:
- [playlist from
