# Resources for Informatics

Resources for informatics that I used during my undergraduate studies.

## Networks

- [Jim Kurose](https://www.youtube.com/@JimKurose) - actually whole the channel
  is about networks, he provides just enough information.

- [cs144](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6RdenZrxrw9inR-IJv-erlOKRHjymxMN)
  a playlist from two guys explaining pretty well how networks work. Something
  happened to their channel, thus, I found only this playlist.

## OCaml
- [cornell
  playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLre5AT9JnKShBOPeuiD9b-I4XROIJhkIU)
  explains clearly and step by step. The videos are short, but there are
  plenty of them and they cover everything you would only need.

  This playlist is the only resource you need.

## Algorithms
I don't have much resources for this course. I didn't find resources that would
cover our course, thus I just prepared by labs and past exams.

- [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDfGc8rbQ0_58oEZQVtvoIc) - visual explanations of algorithms.

## Graphical Programming 
- [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/@Computerphile) - just look for videos you need on this channel, usually they explain all you need.
