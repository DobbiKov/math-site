Resources to study abstract algebra (structure algebrique).

- [long playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLL0ATV5XYF8AQZuEYPnVwpiFy0jEipqN-)
    short video with explanations, good to acquire understanding and intuition.

- [short
  playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLug5ZIRrShJHDvvls4OtoBHi6cNnTZ6a6)
  also helped me to understand some topics, worth mentioning. 
  Especially for:
  - quotient groups
  - normal subgroups
  - conjugations
  - first isomorphism theorem

- [Another playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-gb0E4MII1YlnI7OBsUHQ5E42RA-ZVI) - I didn't really use it but it may help someone.

- [partial fractions explanation](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/partial-fractions.html)

## Michael Penn
This guy is genius. We loved him when we studied abstract algebra and we love
him today. He explains everything as clear as possible, just, the GOAT.

He has two channels:
- [Michael Penn](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelPennMath/playlists) - the
  videos there are short but he explains each concept separately. You can find
  playlists by subject you need.
- [Math Major](https://www.youtube.com/@mathmajor/playlists) - also his
  channel, but the videos are longer (around 1-2 hours), more lecture format.

And now, his playlists I used:
- [abstract algebra (long videos)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVMgvCDIRy1y4JFpnpzEQZ0gRwr-sPTpw)
- [congruence and modulo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqwQAuvbGttzo2G1i7Z9j6Oq)
- [abstract algebra short videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL22w63XsKjqxaZ-v5N4AprggFkQXgkNoP)

I genuinely recommend to take at look at playlists on both of his channels,
because there are themes that are covered in other playlists, or where he
provides more examples.
